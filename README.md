# CubeGenerics

Computational Geometry provides a number of useful abstractions for graphically
depicting the visual and spatial relationships between data elements.
For example, the faces of a hypercube can be modeled via templatized 2D matrices.
This project experiments with Swift 4.2+ Generics to model some parameterized types,
testing ideas using conditional conformance, functions as first-class objects, and
various protocols.
